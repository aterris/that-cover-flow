Intro:
  This was originally created for an actionscript class at DePaul.  It currently needs a lot of work.

Work Needed:
 -fix tween problems
 -improve graphics/animations
 -add preloader
 -create developer interface
 -add depth to slides
 -refactor code

 I will add to this list as new things come up.
