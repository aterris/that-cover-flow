This was originally created for an actionscript class at DePaul.  It currently needs a good amount of work, but I am going to try and get it to a point where it could be useful.

Some things it needs:
 more dynamic code
 developer interface
 other styles (ie Xbox 360 style cover flow)
 improve design/animations
 add preloader
 refactor code
 
 There is probably more, but those are a few.  I will add more as they come up.
